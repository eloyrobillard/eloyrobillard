## Current reads

- Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory
- JavaScript 7th ed. by David Flanagan

## Recent Projects

- CHIP-8 emulator written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/): https://github.com/eloyrobillard/odin-chip-8
- Godot 2D platformer prototype with teleportation enabled ([itch.io demo](https://autoparanoid.itch.io/gates)): https://github.com/eloyrobillard/godot-weird-block

## Current Project

- Godot 2D platformer first built with friends for a game jam, where you can't directly control your character ([itch.io demo](https://orderas.itch.io/laggy-bot))
  - The hard part is making this playable. Right now, the first (and only) level is essentially impossible 
- A raytracer in C (very early stage): https://github.com/eloyrobillard/c-raytracer
- NAND2Tetris: completed everything up to the VM (in [Haskell](https://github.com/eloyrobillard/hs-nand2tetris-vm) and [Clojure](https://github.com/eloyrobillard/clj-nand-2-tetris), when I realised the latter can't be used for submissions on the Coursera page 🥲)
